- 45 Transistors, right next to ALU, gets hot
- SRAM
	- Separated into cache levels
		- L1 - Runs loops in programming, if too big overflows into l2
		- L2 - 
		- L3 - Shared between CPUs, pass data between CPUs
- DRAM
	- Simple, 1 transistor with 1 capacitor, very compact
	- Slowest
	- Has to be refreshed -> read data out and write it back in 
		- Because it leaks
