# Overview
- Introduction to AI: Search and Reasoning
- Intelligence: assuming we have some knowledge or model how do we actually apply it
- Cover everything that went into alpha go -> revived AI

# Chapters
1. Classical Search
	- Review DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, A* (Add one ingredient to Dijkstra)
2. Adversarial Search
	- Play chess, minimax tree
	- Vertical/Horizontal Pruning
	- Games are interesting because there is an adversarial agent trying to win against the agent
1. Reinforcement Learning
	- 4 week topic, markov decision processes, "holy grail of AI"
	- Play black jack
2. Monte Carlo Tree Search
	- Major part of alpha go system
	- WIll impelemnt gomoku

# History
- A* was created in 1950s and 1960s
- Not algorithms that are important
