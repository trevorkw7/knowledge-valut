## KVL and KCL
KCL: $i_e = i_{C} + i_{B}$
KVL : $V_{BC} = V_{BE} - V_{CE}$
Note: $V_{CE} = V_{C }- V_{E}$

## Modes of Operation and Applications
Modes of Operation:
1. Cutoff
	- No current flows through because $i_{C} = 0$ and $i_{B} = 0$ therefore via KCL $i_{E} = 0$
	- Occurs when $V_{BC}$ junction is NOT forward biased
	- 
1. Saturation
	- Large current flows through 
2. Active
Application:
- Switch
	- Either in cutoff or saturation region
	- 
- Active
	- In Active region

## Examples
1.Solving for $i_{C}$ and $V_{CE}$ by assuming cutoff mode, checking if $V_{BE}$ was below $V_{DO}$,  then assuming active mode and checking $V_{CE}$   ![[Pasted image 20231020131348.png]]
