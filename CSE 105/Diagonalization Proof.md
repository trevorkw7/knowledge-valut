## Proof by Contradiction
- Assume there is a decider $M_{ATM}$ that can decide $A_{TM}$ (defined in [[Undecidable Computational Problems]])
- By definition for every TM $M$ and every string $w$
	- Computation of $M_{ATM}$ on $<M,w>$ halts and accepts if w is in $L(M)$
	- Computation of $M_{ATM}$ on $<M,w>$ halts and rejects if w is not in $L(M)$
- Make a new TM D to contradict itself
	- Define TM D = "On input $<M>$:
		- Typecheck $<M>$
		- Run $M_{ATM}$ on $<M, < M>>$"
			- Running the input M on the encoding of itself through the decider
		- If $M_{ATM}$ accepts, reject; if $M_{ATM}$, accept
	- Since $M_{ATM}$ is a decider, $D$ is a decider 
	- Consider running D on input $<D>$:
		- Case 1: the $M_{ATM}$ computation halts and accepts
			- The pair $<D, <<D>>$ is in $A_{TM}$ so $M_{ATM}$ accepts D
			- Then D will reject $<D>$
			- CONTRADICTION
		- Case 2: computation halts and rejects
			- The pair $<D, <<D>>$ is not in $A_{TM}$ so $M_{ATM}$ rejects D
			- Then D will accept $<D>$
			- CONTRADICTION
- Since $M_{ATM}$ is impossible to build $A_{TM}$ is undecidable
- D is supposed to do the opposite of what's in the diagnal cell, what happens when they meet?![[Pasted image 20231130230817.png]]
