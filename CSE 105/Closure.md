## Definition
- Closed under **Unary Operation**:
	- means that for any elements under unary operation $F$: $s \in S, F(s) \in S$
	- "For any element in the set, after applying the operation to that element the element is still in that set"
	- Examples: $x \in \mathrm{Re}, \mid x\mid \in \mathrm{Re}$
- Closed under **Binary Operation**:
	- for any elements under binary operation $G$,  $s_{1}, s_{2} \in S, G(s_{1}, s_{2}) \in S$
	- "For any two elements in the set, after applying the operation to the two elements, the result is also in the set"
	- Example: $x \in\mathrm{Re}, y\in\mathrm{Re}, x+y \in \mathrm{Re}$
