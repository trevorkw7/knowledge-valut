## Definition
- Formally defined via a 7 tuple 
- Consist of a tape and a state machine

## Equivalence
- All of the following have been proven to be equivalent
	- Doubly infinite TM
		- Proof Method: Add a special character to the left most part of the tape and every time we reach it we shift all elements to the right on the tape to make a blank space
	- Multiple tapes
## Usage
- [[Example Computational Problems with TMs]]
