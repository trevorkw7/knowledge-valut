## Definition
- Turing machine halts on all languages, rejects those that are not in it's language and accepts those that are

## Properties
- All finite languages are decidable because we can hardwire each string into the TM
## Closure
- Closed under union:
	- Can use non-determinism to create two branches of state to run the machine in parallel if either one of them accept
	- Can also use the run turning machine M1 for i steps using for loop until accepts, if it accepts. At the same time run M2 for i steps, if that accepts that accept.
- Closed under intersection:
	- Intersection
		- Let $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ be $TMs$:
			- Create $M=$ "on input w:
				- Run $M_{1}$ on w, if $M_{1}$ accepts than run $M_{1}$ else reject
				- IF $M_{2}$ accepts w than accept else reject"
- The following are also closed under non-determinism where we split up the string in all possible ways and run the machine on all possible splittings:
	- Concatenation
	- Kleene Star
- Closed under complementation:
	- Can simply swap states because all languages terminate in either ACCEPT or REJECT

## Decidability and Encoding Computational Problems
- A [[Computational Problems]] is decidable iff the language encoding the problem instances is decidable
- We can represent the objects through the encoding object O into <O> 
	- Object Examples:
		- Matrix
		- Graph
		- DFA
		- CFG
- Computational Example Problems:
	- Does a DFA accept a given string?
		- Encoding: <w, M>
	- Is the language generated by a CFG empty?
	- Is a turing macine a decider?
