## Definition
- Turing machine halts on languages that are in it, may reject/halt or run forever otherwise
- 

## Properties
-  All decideable languages are also recognizable
	- Decidable $\subseteq$ Recognizable
## Closure
- Closed under:
	- Union
	- Concatenation
	- Intersection
	- Kleene Star
- Not closed:
	- Complementation, some languages that weren't previously accepted run forever, cannot change
