### Milestone Planning

- The milestone is the delivery **to the customers**
    - Time frame is closer to a year
- The iterations release **to the users**
    - Kind of like small milestones

### Goals of Requirements Gathering

- Remove assumptions
- Clarify with customers what can be done, figure out if they are asking for too much and give them a level of realism

### Iterating with Requirements

- Repeat on vague ideas until they are right

1. Capture basic ideas
2. Bluesky brainstorming
    1. We bluesky with all stake holders (people affected) to **get unique perspectives on what’s wanted/needed** and to **************************avoid tension**************************, keep morale up by getting everyone involved
3. Construct User Stories
4. Find holes in clarity
5. Create clear customer focused user stories
6. Estimate time to finish while working with team, scientific guess.
7. Get missing information from customer and break up large user stories. Go back to step 4
8. Sum all information into estimates

### User Stories

- Feature has to use customer centric language, don’t talk about APIs
- Feature shouldn’t be too vague, not a system capability (we use tasks for this)
- Role should be as specific as possible, user is lazy
- Benefit is why user will pay

Template:

- Name
    
- As a ************role************ I want _******feature******_ so that **************benefit (in the world**************)
    
- We set the user stories with H, M, or L to prioritize
    
- H is for things that need to be implemented first
    
- M is important but not prerequisite
    
- L doesn’t need to be demoed first time around
    

Examples:

As a student on campus I want an map where I can see my friend’s locations and message them so that I can see who’s nearby since theres a higher chance we can hangout

### Finding Holes in Clarity

- Come up with questions from customers to remove ambiguities for these stories
- Ask questions like when do we update the map? What is meant by tap friends, icon or separate messages? How should we zoom, pinch or tap. How much to zoom in and out? What is considered nearby?

### After Finding Holes, Refine User Stories

- Show nearby friends on map → Display map north oriented zoomable birds eye, defaulting to a city block with me on the center

### Estimate Using Planning Poker

- Estimate how long a user story will take to implement
- This exposes assumptions or ambiguities of the features
- Estimates are course, discuss and repeat to converge on estimate
- Can use powers of 2 to estimate hours, don’t use days
- Stories should be broken up if its too big (32+ hours)

### Get Missing, Info Test Assumptions

- Get frequent feedback on work from user (iterations)

### Estimate Time for Requirements

- Having gone through loop multiple times
- Number will be too big

### User Story Downsides:

- Hard to write
- Alternatives exist
