![[Pasted image 20231101142005.png]]Top of MOSFET is $V_{DD}$, Left is $V_{DG}$, Bottom is $V_{DS}$
$V_{GS} = V_{DS}=V_{i} = V_{1} = 1V$  <- before adding the resistor
Drain voltage is same as gate voltage

For MOSFET to stay in saturation 
$V_{DS} \geq V_{GS} - Vt_{t}$ 
After adding the resistor $V_{GS} = 2.5-IR_{1}$
