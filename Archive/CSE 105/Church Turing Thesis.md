## Definition
- Says that each algorithm can be implemented by some Turing machine
- "Sweeps under the rug" a lot of implementation details

## Thesis Payoff
- We can create and assume subroutines for decode string representations of common objects 
- We can turn problems into [[Language]]s of strings
	- So we can use our notation and terminology to talk about decision problems
-
