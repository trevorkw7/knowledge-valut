- Basically any problem that can be solved by an algorithm
- For example:
	- what is the first prime number that starts with a 2?
	- will this DFA accept string w?

## Notation
In the following notations, $XX$ is the machine type (DFA, NFA, etc.)
$A_{XX}$: 
	- The set of all <B,w> encodings where B is a machine XX that accepts string w
$E_{XX}$
	- The set of all < A > where A is a machine XX that has an empty language
$EQ_{XX}$ 
	- The set of all < A, B > encodings where A is a machine XX that recognizes the same language as B which is another machine XX
