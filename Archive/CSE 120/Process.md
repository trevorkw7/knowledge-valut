## Definition
- Not a program (list of instructions) but a program in execution
- Is dynamic, has state, and changes unlike a program which is static
	- **[[Context]]:** 
		- CPU Context
			- Program Counter (PC)
			- Stack Pointer SP, Frame Pointer FP, GP General Pointer
		- Memory Context
## Basic Resources
 - CPU
	 - Processing cycles
	 - Executes instructions
 - Memory
	 - Bytes or words to maintain state
	 - [[Process Memory Structure]]
	   
 - Other Resources
	 - I/O like printer, network, display, etc.

## Supporting Multiple Processes
- Most processes are waiting instead of running
- [[Multiprogramming]]
- 

- anything that describes what the process is doing at a given moment of time (stack pointer, frame pointer, general, program counter)
