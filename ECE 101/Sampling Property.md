### Sampling Property of $\delta[n]$
- $x[n]\delta[n] = x[0]\delta[n]$
	- Multiplying DT signal $x[n]$ by the unit impulse results in a new signal that's simply an impulse at 0 with the magnitude of $x[0]$
- $x[n]\delta[n-n_{0}] = x[n_{0}]\delta[n-n_0]$
	- Multiplying the DT signal by a time-shifted unit results in a new signal that's simply the impulse at $n_{0}$ with the magnitude of $x[n_{0}]$
