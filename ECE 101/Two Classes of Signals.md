1. [[Unit Impulse Signals]]
	- $\delta(t)$ - continuous
	- $\delta[n]$ - discrete
2. [[Complex Exponential Signals]]
	- In the form $ce^{at}$ for continuous
	- In the form $ce^{an}$ for discrete

 ## Why are these useful?
 - We can represent **lots** of useful signals, almost all that we're interested in practice as **linear combinations** of these 2 classes of signals
