### Representation Property of $\delta[n]$

> [!summary] Formula
> $x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty x[k]\delta[n-k]$
> $x(t) = \int _{-\infty}^\infty x(k)\delta(n-k)\, dk$

> [!note] Discrete
>  - See [[Discrete Time Unit Impulse Signals]]
> - Idea is that we can break any DT signal down into a sum of time shifted impulse signals with magnitudes of the original DT signal

> [!important] Continous
> - Idea is that we can break any continuous signal down into an infinite number of shifted continuous impulses each with magnitudes of the original continuous signal
